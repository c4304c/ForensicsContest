This is the first puzzle on http://forensicscontest.com/ 
Title : Ann's Bad AIM

Investigate the traffic of Ann's computer (192.168.1.158) by downloading the Pcap from the site. (used Wireshark)

    First thing I did was to filter for Ann's IP
 
ip.addr==192.168.1.158

    We know that we are looking for an AIM message (it says so in the title) but in the real world that wouldn't be so easy, so I looked up the IP in ARIN and found:

    The puzzle was published on SEPTEMBER 25, 2009.  So at the time, AOL would have had this IP.  Since we are looking up IMs, it has a good chance to be going to an AIM server. 
    So I decode her first TCP packet (right-click> decode as) from TLS to  AIM.

    This changes the SSL message to unencrypted AIM messages.  Now that we found the AIM transmissions, we will open up the conversation where we see
    "outgoing to message to Sec558user1" (right-click packet 25 > follow > TCP stream).  Here we see the conversation (it is still encoded but is plain text.  
    You can see the message that packet sent in TLV message block if you dig deeper, but this is good for me).  Now we see the message about the secret recipe 
    is intended for Sec558user1.  In this conversation, We immediately have the answer to the first 2 questions.


1. What is the name of Annâ€™s IM buddy?  =  Sec558user1 

2. What was the first comment in the captured IM conversation?  =  Here's the secret recipe... I just downloaded it from the file server. Just copy to a thumb drive and 
you're good to go &gt;:-) 


TO BE CONTINUED (sleepy time)
