Title : Ann's Bad AIM

Investigate the traffic of Ann's computer (192.168.1.158) by downloading the Pcap from the site. (used Wireshark)

    First thing I did was to filter for Ann's IP
 
ip.addr==192.168.1.158

    We know that we are looking for an AIM message (it says so in the title) but in the real world that wouldn't be so easy, so I looked up the IP in ARIN and found:

Source Registry

64.12.0.0 - 64.12.255.255

    The puzzle was published on SEPTEMBER 25, 2009.  So at the time, AOL would have had this IP.  Since we are looking up IMs, it has a good chance to be going to an AIM server. 
    So I decode her first TCP packet (right-click> decode as) from TLS to  AIM.

    This changes the SSL message to unencrypted AIM messages.  Now that we found the AIM transmissions, we will open up the conversation where we see
    "outgoing to message to Sec558user1" (right-click packet 25 > follow > TCP stream).  Here we see the conversation (it is still encoded but is plain text.  
    You can see the message that packet sent in TLV message block if you dig deeper, but this is good for me).  Now we see the message about the secret recipe 
    is intended for Sec558user1.  In this conversation, We immediately have the answer to the first 2 questions.


1. What is the name of Ann’s IM buddy?  =  Sec558user1 

2. What was the first comment in the captured IM conversation?  =  Here's the secret recipe... I just downloaded it from the file server. Just copy to a thumb drive and 
you're good to go &gt;:-) 
3. What is the name of the file Ann transferred?
    Port 5190 is the port used by AIM (according to google), so I filtered for that port  (tcp.port eq 5190).  After research, I found that OSCAR uses OFT to transfer files. So I brought up the conversation of the file after the handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) and found 
OFT2.....................................d..........................Cool FileXfer...............................................................................................................recipe.docx   

This shows a file being transfers names recipe.docx

4. What is the magic number of the file you want to extract (first four bytes)?
     A quick google search shows that magic number for a .docx is 50 4B 03 04 [PK]

5. What was the MD5sum of the file?
We have to abstract the file for this.  To do so,  We have to save the conversation in raw data (saved as ‘recipe.docx’) and remove anything before the magic number and the OFT trailer after the file (beginning after the file).  Run the md5sum command to get the MD5sum.  (I renamed the file from the data I pulled to ‘recipe2.docx’

md5sum recipe2.docx 
8350582774e1d4dbe1d61d64c89e0ea1  recipe2.docx



6. What is the secret recipe?
All that is left is to open the file
